W3C will also post to the [W3C blog](https://www.w3.org/blog/category/website-redesign/) whenever we are encouraging

### Questions via GitHub issues
We use [Basecamp](https://basecamp.com/) for project comms, though when we gather feedback from the wider W3C community 
we are trying to use GitHub issues so this is done in the open.
