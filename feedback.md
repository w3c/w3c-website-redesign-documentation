Coralie Mercier, Head of Marketing & Communications at W3C, is responsible for managing community feedback on this

W3C maintain a [public wiki](https://www.w3.org/wiki/2020_website_redesign) for the project.
You can also subscribe to W3C project updates via the [public mailing list](https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-website-redesign/).
W3C will also post to the [W3C blog](https://www.w3.org/blog/category/website-redesign/) whenever we are encouraging 
public feedback.

### Questions via GitHub issues
We use [Basecamp](https://basecamp.com/) for project comms, though when we gather feedback from the wider W3C community 
we are trying to use GitHub issues so this is done in the open.

submit a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/w3c/w3c-website/issues) to the project repo.
