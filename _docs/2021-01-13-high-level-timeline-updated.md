This is an update to the [high-level timeline published in July 2020] (/docs/high-level-timeline/).

Since July 2020 there have been a number of project areas which have changed the timeline and project approach. An example of some of these areas are:
 * choosing a [headless CMS approach] (/updates/headless-cms/)
 * designing complex functional areas such as the header
 * reviewing additional content not in the original scope, such as all the variations required for listing pages
 * agreeing with W3C that the systems team will build the front-end app alongside us, to better share resource and knowledge.

This work and decisions have affected the high-level timeline, and a new delivery schedule has been worked out based on these changes. This schedule starts from January 2021 for ease of understanding and review. 

There is a [visual version that can be seen on whimsical] (https://whimsical.com/project-approach-v1-4-7F2h75BXXHKKvvR3zDfUUy) and a textual version below.
