# About Studio 24

[Studio 24](https://www.studio24.net/) is an independent digital agency based in Cambridge, UK. We’ve always believed in building a better web, using standards to make sure the sites we build are accessible to all regardless of who you are, what internet access you have, what device you’re using, or any disability you may have. Our company mission to bring together human-centred design and open source technology is ideally fitted to a client such as W3C.

## The project team

The team is a passionate bunch of web designers, content strategists, developers, project managers and client services experts committed to making a better web. Needless to say, the team is very excited to be working with W3C.

### Simon Jones, Founder & Managing Director

#### Role: Technical architect, Project lead

Simon studied English Literature at Anglia Ruskin University. While there he learnt HTML, helped start the first [Varsity Online](https://www.varsity.co.uk/) website and started his journey on the web. Simon founded Studio 24 in 1999 and for over 20 years he has been bringing a mix of strategic insight and technical expertise to client projects. 

Outside of work Simon is a trustee of the charity Cambridge Film Trust who present the annual [Cambridge Film Festival](https://www.cambridgefilmfestival.org.uk/).

### Ian Axton, Creative Director

#### Role: Design lead

Ian joined the studio in 2014, bringing with him a wealth of expertise having helped brands such as Sony, English Heritage and Centrepoint to connect with their audiences. Ian heads up the Studio 24 creative team and works alongside the development team to ensure a seamless and efficient delivery on all projects. He is an advocate of clean, user centred design that allows people to positively engage with brands and their content. 

In his free time, Ian can be found in the pottery studio knee deep in creative projects with his family.

### Ben Challenor, Data & Content Strategist

#### Role: Content lead

Before joining Studio 24 as a Digital Marketing Executive in 2015, Ben had spent several years in Australia where he worked as a freelance digital marketing consultant. Ben’s role evolved to Data and Content Strategist - reflecting the strategic work he had been undertaking for clients to help them analyse, optimise and improve their digital performance. 

Ben loves cinema and is part of the ‘Bums on Seats’ film review show on [Cambridge 105](https://cambridge105.co.uk/) and is co-host of the [Sudden Double Deep: The Triple Bill Title Podcast](https://suddendoubledeep.com/). 

### Carlos Eriksson, Front-end Developer & Accessibility lead

#### Role: Development, Accessibility lead

Carlos believes that the web is built by people, for people. And if we want to make a better web we need to include people from all walks of life. Carlos began his digital journey with a degree in audio visual communication. But the real inspiration for his dedication to digital accessibility came from working closely with people with permanent disabilities. At Studio 24 Carlos has worked with HS2, Heathrow and Crown Commercial Service. 

In his spare time, Carlos is part of a mentoring programme which supports women to get into tech. Carlos also writes [Inclusive by Design](http://superdupercritical.com/), where he gathers a decade of knowledge and experience packed into short, thoughtful and actionable posts on accessibility and inclusive practices.

### Nicola Saunders, Front-end Developer

#### Role: Front-End Development lead

Nicola entered the world of web development from self-taught beginnings. She joined Studio 24 as a Front-End Developer in 2017 after acquiring W3C recognised qualifications in responsive web design and JavaScript. With keen awareness and knowledge of accessibility and inclusive design, Nicola has contributed to multiple client sites including: [Cambridge Film Festival](https://www.cambridgefilmfestival.org.uk/), [Cambridge University Botanic Gardens](https://www.botanic.cam.ac.uk/), [Fauna and Flora International](https://www.fauna-flora.org/), and [UK Parliament](https://learning.parliament.uk/).
