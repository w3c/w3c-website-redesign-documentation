# About Studio 24

[Studio 24](https://www.studio24.net/) is an independent digital agency based in Cambridge, UK. 
We’ve always believed in creating websites that work for everyone, using web standards to ensure sites we build are 
accessible to all regardless of who you are, what internet access you have, what device you’re using, or any access needs 
you may have. 

## The project team

The team is a passionate team of digital experts across design, front-end development, technology, project management,
client services, and marketing all committed to making a better web. The team is very excited to be working with W3C!

### Simon Jones, Founder & Managing Director

#### Role: Technical architect, Project Lead

Simon studied English Literature at Anglia Ruskin University. While there he learnt HTML, helped create the first 
[Varsity Online](https://www.varsity.co.uk/) website and started his journey on the web. Simon founded Studio 24 in 1999 
and for over 20 years he has been bringing a mix of strategic insight, technical expertise, and a belief in web standards 
to client projects. 

Outside of work Simon is a trustee of the charity Cambridge Film Trust who present the annual [Cambridge Film Festival](https://www.cambridgefilmfestival.org.uk/).

### Ian Axton, Creative Director

#### Role: Design lead, Information Architecture Lead

Ian joined the studio in 2014, bringing with him a wealth of expertise having helped brands such as Sony, English 
Heritage and Centrepoint to connect with their audiences. Ian heads up Studio 24's creative work and works alongside 
the development team to ensure a seamless and efficient delivery on all projects. He is an advocate of clean, user 
centred design that allows people to positively engage with brands and their content. 

In his free time, Ian can be found in the pottery studio knee-deep in creative projects with his family.

### Marie Manandise, Front-End Team Lead

#### Role: CMS lead, Technical Lead

Marie first started coding as part of her biology degree course, during which she learned Pascal.
A few years later, she woke up with the urge to make websites for a living. She took courses to turn her scripting skills 
into website building ones and started straight away as a freelance web developer.

Marie joined the studio in 2016 and has focussed on PHP development, CMS projects in Craft CMS and WordPress, and
user research projects where she can bring her expertise to help solve client problems.

She is a big believer in coding best practices and often thinks that, when it comes to web design or development, ‘less is more’.

### Nicola Saunders, Front-End Lead Developer

#### Role: Front-End Development, Accessibility Lead

Nicola entered the world of web development from self-taught beginnings. She joined the studio as a Front-End Developer 
in 2017 after acquiring W3C recognised qualifications in responsive web design and JavaScript. With keen awareness and knowledge of accessibility and inclusive design, Nicola has contributed to multiple client sites including: [Cambridge Film Festival](https://www.cambridgefilmfestival.org.uk/), [Cambridge University Botanic Gardens](https://www.botanic.cam.ac.uk/), [Fauna and Flora International](https://www.fauna-flora.org/), and [UK Parliament](https://learning.parliament.uk/).

### Sean Dunwoody, Senior Web Developer

#### Role: CMS developer

Sean first got into web development, at age 13, after playing online text-based strategy games. He was inspired to teach 
himself HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. He knew from then that he wanted a career in digital as there would always be fresh 
challenges, new things to learn, and new objectives to meet. Sean joined Studio 24 in October 2014 and has expanded his 
knowledge, and honed his skills, to excel as both a front-end developer working in HTML/CSS/JavaScript and a back-end 
developer working in PHP. Sean’s work as a developer has been integral to the success of large projects including 
[Crossrail](https://www.crossrail.co.uk/), [Internet Watch Foundation](https://www.iwf.org.uk/), and [HS2](https://www.hs2.org.uk/).

### Claire McDermott, Head of Delivery

#### Role: User research

Claire’s project management style is to put relationships at the heart of project delivery. In her 3 years at Studio 24, 
she has worked with a broad range of clients, on a diverse number of projects. These include site rebranding for 
Cambridge University Botanic Garden, new corporate websites for HS2 and  Heathrow consultation and legacy site 
maintenance and upgrades for Crossrail. 

Claire is also the Mental Health First Aider for the Studio, and is passionate about raising awareness on the importance 
of mental wellbeing. In previous roles Claire has also worked with a number of well-known brands, such as Shell, 
Michelin and Vauxhall.

### Sazia Islam, Senior UX Designer

#### Role: UX design

Sazia is a user advocate, a systematic problem solver and just generally a people's person. She has a deep toolkit of 
techniques and methods that has helped brands such as Volkswagen, O2, Avios and The Telegraph. She is skilled at user 
research, information architecture, workshop facilitation and user centric design. All in all she just has a passion 
for making others’ lives easier on the web and beyond.

Sazia helped us as a contractor for 3 months in 2020.

### Julia Sang, Senior Project Manager

#### Role: Project Manager

Julia loves the challenge of managing big projects. At Studio 24 she has delivered a range of projects including the 
UK government’s Crown Commercial Service website, the Airspace Expansion Consultation for Heathrow, and global e-commerce 
sites for Urban Bar. Julia always keeps projects under control with a strict eye on client and site priorities. 

Outside of work Julia organises Playing Out sessions in association with the City Council. Before moving to Studio 24, 
Julia worked at IRIS Worldwide with some of the world’s biggest brands including Philips, Britvic and Unilever.

Julia is now at Citizens Advice helping deliver projects that help people from all walks of life.

### Carlos Eriksson, Front-End Developer

#### Role: Front-End Development, Accessibility

Carlos believes that the web is built by people, for people. And if we want to make a better web we need to include 
people from all walks of life. Carlos began his digital journey with a degree in audio visual communication. But the 
real inspiration for his dedication to digital accessibility came from working closely with people with permanent 
disabilities. At Studio 24 Carlos has worked with HS2, Heathrow and Crown Commercial Service.

In his spare time, [Carlos writes on his blog](https://carloseriksson.com/) and [Inclusive by Design](https://superdupercritical.com/), where he gathers a decade of 
knowledge and experience packed into short, thoughtful and actionable posts on accessibility and inclusive practices.

Carlos is now at Redgate Software helping design better software products.
