The first three static templates have been built and deployed to our prototype site. Please note they have not yet been tested for accessibility or across different browers and devices. In addition there are a few styling elements we have noted that need improvement, such as the carousel on the business ecosystem page.   

We will share the test reports on this site once they are ready, around mid March). In the meantime you can view the pages via the links below:
