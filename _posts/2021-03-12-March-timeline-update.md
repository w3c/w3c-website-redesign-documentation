The high-level timeline was last updated in [January 2021](/updates/high-level-timeline-and-approach/). Since then a few challenges have pushed back the timeline. 

1. The decision making process takes time, to make sure we get an agreed consensus from all project stakeholders.
2. The build of the first static templates took longer than expected.
3. Covid-19 has had an impact. The UK-wide lockdown, which started on 26 December, meant we needed to furlough some team members for childcare and another team member caught Covid and needed time off to recover. 

Happily, everyone is now healthy and back in the office full time. It is wonderful to be together as a team again and things have started moving at pace.

The revised timeline and approach starts in January 2021 for ease of readability. The previous version can be accessed on the link above, any changes to this version will be kept via a change log.

There is a [visual version that can be seen on whimsical](https://whimsical.com/project-approach-v1-6-8kd9jVtEaso6e3Cy8Q8Ju5) and a textual version below.
