## Content and design updates

This week the W3C team approved the design and content for the new [homepage](/updates/illustrations/) and have been working very hard on the site map. You may remember, we shared the [initial site map work](/docs/proposed-site-map-v2/) in August 2020. Since then we have been working on the navigation, and following [version 3 of the navigation prototype](/updates/prototyping-the-main-navigation-version-3/), agreed that to get the navigation right, the site map needed to be completed first. Now the W3C have added all their comments on the [current site map](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1a9pm5HWzcidtLPCeFRz4F0Ir4TT3oOK54FlEEd3IXUE/view#gid=315005175), we will need to review the changes, agree any final amends, and make a recommendation on how the navigation can evolve. 

## Development updates

It has been lovely to have Nicki back onto the project this week and to welcome Sean onto the team too. Nicki has been addressing the report issues raised by [DAC](/updates/accessibility-testing-round1/) and [Zoonou](https://w3c.studio24.net/updates/browser-testing-round1/), and making tweaks following design feedback. Sean has been spending time getting to know the project, the tasks in hand and Craft. 



## And the rest...


What was good: home page approval

What we found challenging: give Sean the right amount of context for his work, without overwhelming him with too much information.

What are we looking forward to: finalising the first static templates so we can tick them off our list!
