The high-level timeline was last updated in [March 2021](/updates/March-timeline-update/). Since then, the delivery timeline moved from August 2021 to November 2021. This was to accommodate some areas of work taking longer than anticipated (such as the build of the headless Symfony app). 

The revised timeline and approach starts in August 2021 for ease of readability. The previous version can be accessed on the link above, any changes to this version will be kept via a change log.

There is a [visual version that can be seen on whimsical](https://whimsical.com/project-approach-v1-8-WtzC4847WWWAoNju1dPZ8a) and a textual version below.
