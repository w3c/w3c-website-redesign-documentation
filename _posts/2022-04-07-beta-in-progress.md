It's been 2 years since we started work with W3C on the redesign of the iconic w3.org (we kicked things off 
in March 2020, just as the pandemic started!). It's been a privilege working with the talented and experienced team at W3C
on a website that has such a valuable mission to develop and promote web standards to help everyone build a better web.

It's been a bit quiet here over the past six months. Our goal in that time has been to work on fixes and improvements to help 
enable building out the site and content entry. We've worked on a number of smaller sprints of work to tackle bugs 
and specific tasks to help W3C build out the Beta site. 
We've been customising the [Craft CMS](https://craftcms.com/) setup to help with content entry, helping prepare 
for testing, completed the final device compatibility tests with [Zoonou](https://zoonou.com/) and accessibility tests with 
[Digital Accessibility Centre](https://digitalaccessibilitycentre.org/) on pages with real content,
been working on various fixes from the [GitHub issues board](https://github.com/w3c/w3c-website/issues), and setting up HTTP 
caching at Cloudflare and mechanisms to purge the cache automatically via Craft CMS.

W3C have been busy using the [Design System](https://design-system.w3.org/) to help build out different sections of the W3C site 
in Symfony, migrating content from other systems into Craft, and writing content for the site and populating this in the CMS. 

Apart from some handover tasks, Studio 24's main work on this project has now concluded and we're handing things over to 
the W3C team to continue. The w3.org site has been around for over 30 years and is a large site, so there's a lot of 
content to get right. At present it's likely the Beta website will launch later in 2022, around autumn time. We'll be 
keeping in touch with W3C and looking forward to seeing the results along with the rest of the community!

The team at Studio 24 have learnt a huge amount during our work with W3C, from how to tackle large projects to our approach 
with HTML/CSS, internationalization, and accessibility for sites that need AAA support. 

Three posts we've written recently about our experiences can be read on our blog:

* [Agency growth: how we made the most of working with W3C](https://www.studio24.net/blog/agency-growth-working-with-w3c/)
* [The irresistible force and the immovable object](https://www.studio24.net/blog/the-irresistible-force-and-the-immovable-object/)
* [Amplify: our accessible front-end starter kit](https://www.studio24.net/blog/amplify-our-accessible-front-end-starter-kit/)

We plan to continue to write and talk about our experiences on this project and our mission to create accessible websites
and digital services for all. You can keep up-to-date on our [blog](https://www.studio24.net/blog/) ([RSS feed](https://www.studio24.net/blog/rss))
