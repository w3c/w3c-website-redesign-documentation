The new design for W3C has been launched on the Beta website beta.w3.org to gather community feedback. 

This is an exciting development and is the result of over 2 years of work from the W3C team, [Studio 24](https://www.studio24.net/), 
with help from [CraftCMS](https://craftcms.com/), [Digital Accessibility Centre (DAC)](https://digitalaccessibilitycentre.org/) and 
[Zoonou](https://zoonou.com/).

The plan is to test the site until W3C are ready to launch this live on the production website, w3.org.

We welcome [feedback on the Beta website](https://github.com/w3c/w3c-website).

You can find other ways to get involved on our [feedback page](../feedback.md).
