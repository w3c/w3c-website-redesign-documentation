The new design for W3C has been launched on the Beta website [beta.w3.org](https://beta.w3.org/) to gather community feedback. 

This is an exciting development and is the result of over 2 years of work from [W3C](https://www.w3.org/) and [Studio 24](https://www.studio24.net/), 
with help from [CraftCMS](https://craftcms.com/), [Digital Accessibility Centre](https://digitalaccessibilitycentre.org/) and 
[Zoonou](https://zoonou.com/).

Studio 24 worked on the project between March 2020 and May 2022 and have provided support to W3C since then. The W3C 
Systems Team and Marketing and Communications Team have been hard at work building pages, writing content and updating the 
Beta website.  

W3C plan to gather community feedback and test the Beta website before updating the live w3.org website later in 2023.

We welcome [feedback on the Beta website](https://github.com/w3c/w3c-website).

You can find other ways to get involved on our [feedback page](../feedback/).
